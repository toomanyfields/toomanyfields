# TooManyFields Indev 0.1

A modern [React](https://react.dev/) component library for content-driven applications inspired by [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) with out-of-the-box bindings for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Features

- Users & Roles
- Pages
- Post Types
- Taxonomies
- Menus
- Options Pages
- Field Groups
- Field Types

## Getting started

Start the boilerplate (Next.js + TooManyFields) by cloning the repo, then running it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toomanyfields/toomanyfields.git

npm run dev
```

Or add it manually to your existing Next.js application:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toomanyfields/toomanyfields.git

cp -R toomanyfields/src/tmf your-app/src 

# ensure that your package.json and tailwind.config.ts files
# are set up in accordance with the corresponding files found in toomanyfields.
```

Or cherry-pick the components you need from the repository. The aim is to provide components that you can copy and paste into your apps instead of having to install a closed source library that stiffles your development process.

## Support

During the initial development phase (Indev), you are welcome to utilize the project in its current state. Feel free to incorporate components into your own project. The goal is to reach a point where every component is in a minimally usable state, from which we will then progressively enhance and expand upon. But beware; _Expect breaking changes in these initial versions_.

## Pro version

- Clone (PRO)
